# sylverant-realtime

## Introduction
Sylverant Realtime is a web extension for the Phantasy Star Online Dreamcast private server.
The Sylverant Realtime Extension provides quality of life updates to the servers website.
This includes removing the current 'refresh' button that you need to click to refresh the
servers player population. We made this process realtime, so you will always see
the most current count without having to do any manual actions. We also
provide a list of all the best guides, streamers, and available game 
patches that currently exist. Sylverant Realtime keeps you connected
to all things PSO and Sylverant!
